File System should include:
1. Read and write to files (.txt to begin with)
2. Create and delete files
3. Move a file from one location to another
4. Create a folder(?)
5. Move a folder from one location to another(?)
6. Support more file formats than just .txt(?)

Gameplan:
One java file will be the "system" file which will include all the methods necessary for the file system
	Ie. Read, write, etc...
	This file will have all the methods and no testing for organizational reasons.
One java file will be the "test" file which will have the main function and run each method in order to ensure
They work.
Read and write will be implemented first because they are the most simple
	fileRead
		Reads text from a .txt file and logs it into the console or stores it into a variable to be used
		elsewhere
		The input should be the filepath to the file being searched for.
	fileWrite
		Writes from the console or from a variable into a .txt file in a given location
		Two methods, one from reading from console (user input), and one for reading from a string
		variable
Deleting and creating files next
	fileDelete
		Gets a file by name (inputted) and deletes it from its current directory (also inputted to avoid
		situations where the incorrect or multiple files get deleted)
	fileCreate
		Creates a file in a given directory with a given name
Moving files afterwards
	fileMove
		Takes in input of where a file currently is, the name of that file, and the location to move
		it to.
		Creates a new file of that name in the desired location and deletes the file in the first
		location (though not necessarily in that order)
Creating folders etc.. if there is time
	Will be worked on at a later time.
